# Semantic Segmentation Tutorial

Below we provide more detailed instructions of utilizing MCD dataset for semantic segmentation. 

## 1. Data organization and pre-processing
We mainly follow the data organization of SemanticKITTI so that most existing backbones tested on SemanticKITTI can be easily adopted on MCD. After downloading the annotated lidar, we suggest users to follow the detailed organization instruction as in [this tutorial](https://github.com/mcdviral/mcdviral.github.io/blob/master/pcd_to_bin.ipynb) to pre-process the data.

## 2. Training/Testing with Different Backbones
TBD
